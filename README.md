# Project 15: React with full API!

Almost there:

Draft 1:

* Organization is a bit of a mess. Takes a while to read.
* Haven't tested on the live server yet, so we'll see how this goes.
* Error handling could be cleaner, and I have yet to test every possible type of error. Yay for bug fixing.
* Postman is my friend.

Draft 2:

* Fixed message issues with central error handling.
* Added Celebrate validation to all routes.
* Added RegEx to password fields.
* Added error handling for MongoErrors and Celebrate errors
* Moved logs to an auto-generated log folder
